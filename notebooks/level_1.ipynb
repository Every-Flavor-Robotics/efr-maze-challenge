        "## Maze Challenge Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the rules for the maze challenge:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Goal:** Navigate the robot from the starting point (🏁) to the goal (🏆) in each maze.\n",
        "2.  **Movement:** You can only move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) if there is no wall between your current position and the desired cell.\n",
        "3.  **Information:** Your `choose_move` method in the `MySolver` class only has access to the current robot's position, the cherry's position, and a dictionary of possible moves from your current location. You do not have a global view of the maze.\n",
        "4.  **Cherry:** There is a cherry (🍒) in the maze. Collecting the cherry is optional but will give you bonus points.\n",
        "5.  **Scoring:**\n",
        "    *   Reaching the goal: +1000 points\n",
        "    *   Collecting the cherry: +500 points\n",
        "    *   Each move: -1 point\n",
        "    *   Visiting a cell for the first time: +10 points\n",
        "6.  **Objective:** The goal is to maximize your score over many maze runs. This means finding the goal efficiently and collecting the cherry if it's on a path to the goal that doesn't significantly increase the number of moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pointers for Solving\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some pointers to help you improve your maze solver:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Explore Available Moves:** The `possible_moves` dictionary is crucial. It tells you which directions you can move from your current position.\n",
        "*   **Avoid Walls:** You cannot move through walls. The `possible_moves` dictionary will only contain valid moves.\n",
        "*   **Keep Track of Visited Cells:** The provided `self.visited` list is a good starting point. You can use this to implement algorithms that avoid infinite loops or prioritize exploring new paths.\n",
        "*   **Consider Algorithms:** Common maze-solving algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or even simple wall-following can be adapted to this problem. Remember you only have local information, so a standard implementation might need modification.\n",
        "*   **The Cherry:** Think about how you can integrate collecting the cherry into your strategy. Is it always worth going for? How can you determine if it's \"on the way\"?\n",
        "*   **Experiment and Iterate:** The `run_solver` function allows you to test your solver on a single maze, and `evaluate_solver` runs it on many mazes to get an average score. Use these tools to experiment with different strategies and see how they perform.\n",
        "*   **Local Information Only:** This is the key constraint. You cannot \"see\" the whole maze. Your decision must be based *only* on your current position, the cherry's position, and the available moves from your current position.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good luck!"
